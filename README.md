## Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* jQuery 
* jQuery UI 
* handlebars
* FontAwesome 

## Installation

I've not placed any mp3 files and their respective cover images as they are copyrighted. You can add mp3 files on the songs folder and images in the assets folder. However, you'll have to change the metadata related to a song in data.js as per your mp3 and images filenames. Just launch mp3.html and you're good to go.
